Old game project. Worked on 20 years ago!<br>

There is a executable in there that requires a Directplay installation. This Windows will handle automatically.<br><br>

The code needs cleaning up. It was to hard for me back than. I was not able to solve some bugs.<br><br>

The gfx was made by I think it was 'Scott' (I forgot his last name). He wanted to market the game when it was finished.<br><br>

The music in the folder is by me.<br><br>
