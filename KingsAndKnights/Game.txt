Sounds by various
Music by Amiga - some versions not enabled


Latest additions/bugfixes

version 1.29
- Fixed a bug with the goto feature where you could not
move to positions that held your units.
- Tweaked the ai-general so he would use all active forces
until they have no turns left.
- Hopefully fixed a bug where units without moves would 
be shown flickering after the ai general was finished.
- Right mouse button can now also be used to speed up the 
enemy play and player/enemy battles.
