@First Message
Welcome to Ripper

Ripper is a tool based slightly on Smartdraw. The tool
is written to allow myself to design user interfaces
quickly. Ripper does this quite well.

Ripper can generate custom code for your programming
language. What it does is replace occurences of keywords
in preset strings.

For instance the string :

myguidrawwindow(x1,y1,width,height,string)

becomes

myguidrawwindow(25,25,320,240,"mytitle")

Ripper is still in its development phase. More features
will probably be added over time.

Read thru the tutorial any time to learn more
about the program





@Creating a Object
Creating a object.

Ripper uses objects. Objects are shown as rectangular
areas on the screen. The Objects view allows you to
insert information into them.

You can create a object by going into Edit Mode -
shown in the Edit Window and drawing a rectangle
on the canvas. You can then activate a object by
pressing record.

@Objects Editor
The Objects Editor contains the information of your
objects. The main tab view shows you the following
things :

Main View

Object #x 	-	The current object, use 
			the slider to move between
			objects.

Area Text 	-	The text shown inside the
			rectangle.
X1		-	The x location of the object
			on the canvas.
Y1		-	The y location of the object
			on the canvas.
X2		-	The right outer edge of the
			object.
Y2		- 	The bottom outer edge of the
			object.
Width		-	The width of the object.
Height		-	The height of the object.
Object Type	-	The type of object you want
			it to be depending on the
			configuration.
Record Current	-	Record ontop of the current
			object.
Record + New	-	Record ontop of the current
			object and move the object view
			to a new empty object.
New Object	-	Move the object view to a
			empty object.
Delete Object	-	Deletes the current object.
Hide Object	-	Hides or Unhides the current
			object.
Unhide All	-	Unhide all objects.

Extra View :

Object Number	-	Give this object a number.
Object Name	-	Give this object a name.
Group to	-	Group to a other objects
			coordinates.





@Generator
The output Generator

What the generator does is make a textfile out of the
objects information. It does this by using key strings
that objects point to. The key strings contain keywords
that the generator uses to fill in the objects
information.

Keywords are : 

x1
y1
x2
y2
width
height
name
group
string
#num
#id

Each keyword will be replaced by the objects
information.

You can create new strings using these keywords by 
pressing 'add new' or edit the current strings.
Strings will be saved when you save the programs
configuration from the file menu.

Press Generate to create the code. Copy the text out
of the window and paste it in your code editor.

@Main View
Main View

The main view of the program consists of a grid display
and Tool windows.

The grid is a 2*1024 by 2*768 screen. It can be moved
using the sliders or using the middle mouse button.

The tool windows are :

Edit Window 	-	Here you can select which mode
			to use. Selection or Creation.
Objects Editor	-	This is the window that 
			displays the object information.
			The contents can also be
			edited.
OverView	-	This is a small view of the
			entire canvas. You can see
			where on the canvas you are
			and by pressing the left mouse
			button on this window move
			to that area of the canvas.


The main Toolbar

The main view also has a toolbar. Here you can create
a new Project (Erases the current one). Cut the
current selection. Copy the current Selection and
Paste the objects you have in memory.
